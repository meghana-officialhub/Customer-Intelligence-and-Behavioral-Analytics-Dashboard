## 📌 Business Problem Statement

Retail businesses often struggle to understand:

- Which customer segments drive the most revenue?
- How purchase frequency impacts profitability?
- Whether discounts influence customer satisfaction?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL** – Data querying & transformation  
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling & dashboard development  
- **DAX** – KPI development & dynamic calculations  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Exploratory Data Analysis  
- **PowerPoint** – Executive-level business presentation  

---

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation

- Cleaned and structured customer-level dataset
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies
- Created derived metrics such as:
  - Average Order Value (AOV)
  - Frequency categories
  - Revenue contribution
  - CLV proxy metric

---

### 2️⃣ SQL-Based Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Using PostgreSQL:

- Revenue aggregation by customer segment
- Frequency vs spending analysis
- Subscription behavior analysis
- Discount impact evaluation
- Segment-wise performance ranking

Advanced SQL techniques used:

- GROUP BY aggregations
- Window functions
- Subqueries
- CASE statements
- Joins for multi-table analysis

---

### 3️⃣ Python Exploratory Data Analysis

Using Python:

- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Segment comparison visualizations
- Revenue contribution patterns
- Purchase behavior trends

This step validated patterns before dashboard implementation.

---

### 4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Development

The final output is an interactive dashboard designed for business decision-makers.

#### 📊 Dashboard Highlights

- Executive KPI Overview
- RFM-Based Customer Segmentation
- Revenue Contribution Analysis
- Frequency vs AOV Visualization
- Subscription Behavior Insights
- Discount vs Rating Impact Analysis
- Interactive Filters & Drilldowns

---

## 📊 Key KPIs Developed

### Customer Metrics
- Total Customers
- Active vs At-Risk Customers
- Segment Distribution
- Customer Lifetime Value (Proxy)

### Revenue Metrics
- Total Revenue
- Revenue by Segment
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Revenue Contribution %

### Behavioral Metrics
- Purchase Frequency
- Subscription Rate
- Discount Utilization
- Review Rating Comparison

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Revenue is heavily dependent on **Occasional Customers** (volume-driven growth).
- **Champions have the highest AOV** but represent a smaller base.
- Increased frequency does not significantly increase basket value.
- Discounts show minimal impact on review ratings.
- Subscription-based customers exhibit stronger repeat purchase behavior.

---

## 🎯 Business Recommendations

- Convert Occasional Customers into Loyal segments.
- Design targeted upselling strategies for Champions.
- Reduce dependency on blanket discounting.
- Promote subscription-based retention programs.
- Implement personalized engagement campaigns.
